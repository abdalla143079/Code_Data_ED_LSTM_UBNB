* This repository contains the code used for conducting the study, which applies an encoder-decoder LSTM model for 14-day ahead streamflow forecasting in the Upper Blue Nile Basin.

* The code was originally hosted on our Google Drive and was executed in the Google Colab environment.

* To run the code locally, download the repository and update the main directories by removing the Google Drive references.

* The folders contain all the models and all the outputs, the notebook reads from the folder
